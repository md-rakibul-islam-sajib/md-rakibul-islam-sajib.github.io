	  <h3>MOTIVATION FOR STUDYING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING(CSE):</h3>
	   I study computer science personally and i'm still doing so right now. 
	   The reason why I fell in love with computers is simply because it responds to me. 
	   <br>I'm naturally very curios and creative so I needed something to keep my restless 
	   mind going and I found computers to be the answer.<br>
	  
	  <h3>FUTURE PLAN:</h3>
	   I want to be a great programmer.<br>
